Everyone&rsquo;s ideas have limits so I highly value being able to interact with and learn from users and co-workers through research, interviews and testing to explore different perspectives. My dream job would push me to learn new technologies, glean new understandings of how people operate, work collaboratively and use creative ideas to solve problems.

It was a round based game with two phases where the players first built defenses for their flag then fought to get their opponents flags. This taught me the basics of cooperative development; using github, having discussions, sharing ideas and making compromises. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">One example of a design consideration in this project was making sure that the players could not create impenetrable defenses. Our solution was to have a timed intermediate stage where players prove that it&rsquo;s possible to capture their flag. I remember we tested different punishments for this, initially redoing the round, which was not chosen as it punished the innocent players, then not letting them play the round. We ended up just removing points as it keeps up the arcade pace of the game and doesn&rsquo;t punish someone &nbsp;badly if they didn&rsquo;t realise what they had to do.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">I also learnt about the importance of having well-structured code, user testing (with friends) and designing for people breaking the system. I had lots of fun working with my friend on this and was really happy to have a bit of a community around it during the peak, some users running custom servers, gaining almost 4k views on the workshop page, over 2k downloads and 182 ratings for an average of 4 stars. The only negative of this project was dealing with Lua and GMod&rsquo;s fiddly networking code.</span></p><p class="c7 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.ibrywu1c7c1x"><span class="c10">Multiplayer Audio Songmaker App (2016)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After 2 years of Computer Science I wanted something more creative, human centric and personally interesting than the algorithms, compilers and discrete mathematics I had been learning. I took a break from study and got a job doing freelance Android development for a client wanting to create an MVP of collaborative music making app. I enjoyed having a lot of freedom in interface decisions - thinking about what we were trying to get the user to do in any given frame and how the high-level pages of the interface should flow together. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One thing I learnt from this experience was that having multiple ways to get to the same endpoint isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; my imagined best route of interaction isn&rsquo;t necessarily what will come to mind for others and if we can allow for different ways to have the same result, we can support different people and mindsets. For example, a user should be able to first select their friends and settings before starting to record or be able to start recording straight away. If we structure the interface in a way that allows diversity of interaction without obfuscating existing methods, we are able to reduce frustrations.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I also was able to have fun with little generative visual elements like waveforms and got to experiment with alternate feedback methods like vibration and audio to tell the user when to start recording. Unfortunately I do not have visuals of this project as it was internal for a client and has not been publicly released.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.bibhmk3pxknm"><span class="c10">Creative Coding Projects (2017/2018)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 325.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 325.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A collection of my favourite creative coding projects.

I worked collaboratively with PhD researcher and lecturer Gillian McCarthy to create a skill that provided something of value to blind users. We went through many cycles of research, scoping and iteration throughout the project. Our first cycle involved me exploring the technology by making an experimental adventure multiplayer game using the alexa platform. This really helped me understand the restrictions in user speech interpretation, for example you must strike a balance between specific expected sentences that are easy for alexa to interpret and more general sentences that are more human. Taking into account the use case of the skill, how much information you are trying to get from the user and what other interactions the user could have with the skill, you have to balance the technology and human-based problems.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After this experimentation, we took what I had learnt and what Gillian already knew into user interviews. We wanted to find out what we could do to actually have an impact in their lives, given the limitations of the technology. We explored topics of community, transport, identity, technology (existing understanding, expectations), fun, social issues for visually impaired people. It was important that we asked these questions in neutral ways that removed our own bias and expectations from the interview, such as that being blind is a painful or negative thing where for some it&rsquo;s simply a fact of life they pay no notice to. This way, we get a full picture of what they think instead of a reaction to what we said.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We had some good directions before we started the user interviews, and by the end we were figuring out what ideas resonated with them. One focussed on transport, another on learning alexa and yet another on accessing blind foundation information. For various reasons including technology and the values the interviewees expressed, we went the route of developing an event discovery system that hooked into </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.eventfinda.co.nz/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560988639353000">eventfinda.co.nz</a></span><span class="c1">. I use their api to generate the voice models which allows us to interpret real locations and venues around New Zealand. We used visual planning tools such as UX flow charts, sticky note idea maps and kanban boards in order to organise our thoughts and decisions. The biggest focus once the core interaction was finished was making the slope of difficulty through tutorialisation perfect so that users of all skill levels felt supported without holding back or confusing others. It is a balancing act, not an optimisation problem, which requires creativity, testing, conversations and experimentation. The skill is currently going through the approval process with Amazon and will be available online soon.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.v8xtccbzwb9y"><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://github.com/edeetee/pictocraft&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560988639353000">Pictocraft - Minecraft Translation for non-verbal special needs kids</a></span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I am currently working on this project as an independent research paper in order to receive the final points required to get my degree.

I have a friend who works in one such classroom where he utilises minecraft to teach kids social skills such as sharing, collaboration and communication through the medium of video games where they are comfortable and happy to explore and experiment.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I am working on implementing a modification of Minecraft that directly places this translation technology into the existing multiplayer messaging, allowing these non-verbal users to have some level of communication with other players. The technology isn&rsquo;t always perfect, but even being able to transfer some kind of information like &ldquo;I want to build a house on a hill&rdquo; would be incredibly useful in learning self confidence and communication skills. I am currently focusing on making this both work well for kids and making the system easy to set up for teachers and caregivers. I hope to publish it through open source to allow anyone to use it for free or to extend upon it if they so desire.</span></p></body></html>
